Development
-----------
Patches may be contributed via pull requests to
https://github.com/release-engineering/ubi-manifest.

All changes must pass the automated test suite, along with various static
checks.

The [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) code style is enforced.
Enabling autoformatting via a pre-commit hook is recommended:

```
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pre-commit install
```

Dev-env setup:
--------------

For running ubi-manifest related containers one can use provided docker-compose file.
For succesfull running of celery tasks, it's required to properly update the config file ./conf/app.conf
with credentials to pulp and gitlab repository with ubi-config files.
There are certs prepared in ./conf/certs/ for accessing dependent services, 
if any different certs are required, copy them to the directory.

Then podman-compose can be used for building and running the service:
```
podman-compose build
podman-compose up -d
```
Service should be available at 127.0.0.0:8000.

For removing containers:
```
podman-compose down
```
